Let's make a Rock Paper Scissor Game

Let's make a rock-paper-scissors game where it is the player vs the computer. 
The computerâ€™s answer will be randomly generated, while the program will ask the user for their input.

Thinking Of Process:
I know that my solution is not unique, the above answer may be got by other processes.So, here I am going to share my idea.
Firstly here we have to work with randomly which can be solved the problem of computer's internal generation.
Then I have worked with list and while loop. We also made a variable called maximum which will keep track on the maximum 
between user's score and computer's score and the limit of the game has been inputted at the beginning of the whole process.
Other important rules and general rules are being described in between the game.
