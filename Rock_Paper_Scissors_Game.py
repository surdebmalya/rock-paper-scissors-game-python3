'''Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:
    Make a rock-paper-scissors game where it is the player vs the computer. 
    The computerâ€™s answer will be randomly generated, while the program will 
    ask the user for their input. This project will better your understanding 
    of while loops and if statements.'''
